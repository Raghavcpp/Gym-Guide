### Gym Training Guidance

#### General Tips:
1. **Warm-Up and Cool-Down:** Start each session with a 5-10 minute warm-up (e.g., light cardio, dynamic stretches) and end with a cool-down (e.g., static stretches, foam rolling) to prevent injuries.
2. **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight or intensity of your exercises to continue making progress.
3. **Proper Form:** Focus on performing each exercise with correct form to maximize effectiveness and prevent injuries. If unsure, ask a trainer for assistance.
4. **Rest and Recovery:** Ensure adequate rest between sets (1-2 minutes) and give muscle groups at least 48 hours to recover before working them again.
5. **Nutrition:** Maintain a balanced diet with sufficient protein, carbs, and healthy fats to fuel your workouts and aid recovery.
6. **Hydration:** Stay hydrated before, during, and after your workouts.
7. **Consistency:** Stick to your schedule and be consistent with your workouts for the best results.
